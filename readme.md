## Methodology

### VADER Sentiment Analysis

#### Key Features:
- **üìö Lexicon and Rule-Based**: Uses a predefined list of words (lexicon) and rules to determine the sentiment of a text.
- **üì∫ Social Media Focused**: Effective for short, informal texts like tweets, comments, and reviews.
- **üíØ Sentiment Scores**: Provides scores for positive, negative, and neutral sentiments, along with a compound score for overall sentiment.

---

### Preprocess the Data: 

#### 1. Convert to Lowercase:
Transformed all text in the 'Comment' column to lowercase to ensure uniformity and prevent case-sensitive discrepancies during analysis.
```python
df['Comment'] = df['Comment'].str.lower()
```
#### 2. Remove HTML Anchor Tags:
Removed HTML anchor tags `<a href="...">...</a>` from the comments. This step is intended to clean the text by eliminating hyperlinks and associated text.
```python
df['Comment'] = df['Comment'].replace(r'<a href=".*?">.*?<\/a>', '', regex=True)
```

#### 3. Remove HTML Line Breaks:
Removed HTML line break tags `<br>` from the comments to clean up the text and ensure it's free from unnecessary formatting.
```python
df['Comment'] = df['Comment'].replace(r'<br>', '', regex=True)
```

#### 4. Define Pronouns and Conjunctions:
Created a set of common pronouns and conjunctions. This set will be used to filter out these words from the text in the next step.
```python
pronouns_conjunctions = { ... }
```
#### 5. Define a Function to Remove Pronouns and Conjunctions:
- Extracts all words from a given text using a regular expression.
- Filters out any words that are in the predefined set of pronouns and conjunctions.
- Joins the remaining words back into a single string.
```python
def remove_pronouns_conjunctions(text):
    words = re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', text)
    filtered_words = [word for word in words if word not in pronouns_conjunctions]
    return ' '.join(filtered_words)
```

#### 6. Apply the Function to Each Comment:
Applied the `remove_pronouns_conjunctions` function to each entry in the 'Comment' column to remove the specified words from all comments.
```python
df['Comment'] = df['Comment'].apply(remove_pronouns_conjunctions)
```
#### 7. Make sure there are english comments only
The script uses a language detection algorithm to ensure that only English comments are retained.
```python
def is_english(text):
    try:
        return detect(text) == 'en'
    except:
        return False

df = df[df['Comment'].apply(is_english)]
```

# BERTopic and Sentiment Analysis for YouTube Comments

## BERTopic

### Embedding Models
- **SentenceTransformer `all-mpnet-base-v2`**: Provides the best quality embeddings.
- **SentenceTransformer `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`**: 5 times faster but still maintains good quality.
- **BERTopic's Default Model**: An option when minimal setup is needed.

### Why BERTopic?

#### 1. Handles Short and Noisy Texts
Ideal for short and unstructured texts like YouTube comments. BERTopic effectively processes informal language, slang, and abbreviations.

#### 2. Contextual Understanding
BERTopic leverages transformer-based embeddings to capture the context in which words are used, resulting in better topic extraction and understanding of comments.

#### 3. Dynamic Topic Modeling
Useful for tracking evolving discussions, especially around trending topics. This feature is particularly beneficial for analyzing ongoing conversations, such as those seen in YouTube comment sections.

#### 4. Scalable
BERTopic is efficient for large datasets, making it suitable for channels with vast comment sections. It can scale up easily, maintaining performance even with massive datasets.

#### 5. Probabilistic Topic Assignment
BERTopic assigns probabilities to topics rather than hard clustering. This approach allows for more flexibility and nuanced understanding, as some comments may cover multiple themes.

#### 6. Interactive Visualizations
Rich visualizations, such as **Intertopic Distance Maps**, enable users to explore and interpret the topic structure effectively. These visual aids make it easier to understand relationships between different topics.

## Graphs

### Topic Word Scores
- Each **topic** is represented by a list of **keywords** most strongly associated with that topic.
- **Word scores** (term frequencies) indicate the **relevance** or **contribution** of each word.
- Higher-scoring words highlight the **core meaning** of the topic.

### Intertopic Distance Maps

#### Bubble Sizes
- Each **bubble** represents a **topic**.
- Larger bubbles indicate more **dominant topics** in the dataset.

#### Distances Between Bubbles
- The **distance** between bubbles reflects how **distinct** the topics are.
- **Farther apart** indicates more distinct and **separate themes**, while **closer together** suggests **overlapping themes**.

#### Axes (D1 and D2)
- The axes represent **latent topic dimensions** derived from the data.
- They help to **spatially separate topics**, facilitating easier visualization of the relationships between different themes.

## Limitations

### 1. VADER's Limitations
- **VADER** struggles with recognizing **negation**, **idioms**, and **sarcasm**.
- This can result in **inaccurate sentiment analysis** in cases where sarcasm or complex language is prevalent.

### 2. English-Only Analysis
- The analysis is **limited to English comments** only. Non-English comments are excluded from the sentiment and topic modeling analysis, which may limit the insights in multilingual or international contexts.
